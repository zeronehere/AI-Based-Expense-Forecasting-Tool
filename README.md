# 💸 BudgetWise AI: Expense Forecasting Tool

## 📌 Project Overview
BudgetWise AI is a smart expense forecasting tool that leverages AI/ML to help individuals and businesses manage budgets, predict future spending, and receive actionable insights. It transforms raw expense data into meaningful forecasts and alerts, enabling better financial decisions.

---

## 🧠 Why AI for Expense Forecasting?
- People often overspend without realizing it.
- Manual budgeting is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Estimating future expenses is difficult without predictive tools.

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Use Cases
- Students managing monthly allowances
- Families planning household budgets
- Small businesses controlling operational costs

## 📊 Dataset Preprocessing Summary

| Step | Task | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Load dataset | Reads CSV safely |
| 2 | Handle missing data | Fills numeric with median, text with mode |
| 3 | Remove duplicates | Keeps dataset unique |
| 4 | Fix datatypes | Ensures numeric columns are float/int |
| 5 | Cap outliers | Avoids extreme distortion |
| 6 | Encode categorical | Converts `Occupation`, `City_Tier` into numeric |
| 7 | Feature engineering | Adds `Total_Expenses`, `Savings`, grouped expenses |
| 8 | Logical fixes | Handles overspending and savings consistency |
| 9 | Correlation analysis | Visual check for variable relationships |
| 10 | Scaling | Prepares data for ML |
| 11 | Save cleaned data | Creates `cleaned_expense_data.csv` |
| 12 | Summary stats | Shows overall cleaned data distribution |
