💸 BudgetWise AI: Expense Forecasting Tool — Milestone Roadmap
🚀 Milestone 1: Project Foundation
✅ Overview
Define project scope and objectives

Identify target users: individuals, families, small businesses

Establish core goal: AI-powered forecasting for smarter budgeting

🔍 Why AI?
Automates budgeting

Learns spending habits

Predicts future expenses

Sends real-time alerts

📁 Milestone 2: Dataset Preparation
✅ Tasks
Step	Task	Purpose
1	Load dataset	Reads CSV safely
2	Handle missing data	Fills numeric with median, text with mode
3	Remove duplicates	Keeps dataset unique
4	Fix datatypes	Ensures numeric columns are float/int
5	Cap outliers	Avoids extreme distortion
6	Encode categorical	Converts Occupation, City_Tier into numeric
7	Feature engineering	Adds Total_Expenses, Savings, grouped expenses
8	Logical fixes	Handles overspending and savings consistency
9	Correlation analysis	Visual check for variable relationships
10	Scaling	Prepares data for ML
11	Save cleaned data	Creates cleaned_expense_data.csv
12	Summary stats	Shows overall cleaned data distribution
📦 Output
cleaned_expense_data.csv

Cleaned, normalized, no missing values, no outliers

New columns:

Total_Expenses

Actual_Savings

Savings_Rate

Essential_Expenses

Lifestyle_Expenses

LongTerm_Expenses

Overspending
